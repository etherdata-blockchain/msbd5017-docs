title: Building Frontend App without writing a single line of code
---

# Introduction

In this chapter, we will be using FlutterFlow, a low-code platform for building Flutter apps, to create a frontend application. The best part is that we won't have to write a single line of code!

Our demo app will allow users to interact with a deployed smart contract, which enables them to vote for their favorite candidate. This smart contract is the same one we used in the previous [chapter](/Chapter6/smart-contract).

# Prerequisites

:::tip
We are using AximoLedger to test the application. The deployed contract is at `0x2467F498d9b139a7761f61442790B3d4451431e4` and
[you can follow this link](https://docs.axiomesh.io/en/documentation/getting-started/overview) to know more about how to deploy your smart contract on AximoLedger.

In order to follow along with this chapter, you will need to have the following:

- A FlutterFlow account. You can sign up for one [here](https://app.flutterflow.io).
- A deployed smart contract. You can follow the steps in the previous [chapter](/Chapter6/smart-contract) to deploy one.
- [Web3Dart](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart) to interact with the smart contract.
