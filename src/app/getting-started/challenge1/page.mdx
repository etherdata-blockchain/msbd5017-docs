# Yanami's Thirst Problem

**Yanami** is a cheerful girl with a passion for food. In fact, there are three things in the world that she loves most:

1. Food
2. More food
3. Even more food!

However, Yanami's love for eating has led to an unexpected problem. She's eaten so much that now she's incredibly thirsty!

You are **Nukumizu**, Yanami's good friend, and you've decided to help her out. Your mission is to fill her water bottle, but there's a catch:

> [!Danger] You only have one chance to fill the bottle correctly!

If you don't succeed, Yanami will be upset. She's even made a rather extreme promise: she'll eat your lunch every day for the next month if you fail!

To protect your future meals (and your friendship), you swear to yourself:

> "I will fill the bottle perfectly - not too little, not too much!"

## Your Challenge

Can you help Nukumizu fill Yanami's bottle with the exact amount of water needed? Remember, you must:

- Fill the bottle as much as possible
- Avoid overfilling it
- Do it in just one attempt

Good luck! Yanami's thirst and your future lunches depend on your success!

# The Bottle Filling Game

In this example, we will implement a smart contract named `WaterBottle` that has two functions:

1. `fillBottle(uint256 amount)`: This function fills the bottle with the specified amount of water. The maximum amount is 100.
2. `checkBottle()`: This function checks the current water level in the bottle. Maximum water level is 100.

When acomplishing the challenge, you should be able to interact with the mini game below.

**Try you best to get as high score as possible!**

{' '}

> [!tip]
> You can store the water level in the bottle using a state variable in the smart contract.
> The state variable should be of type `uint256` and should be initialized to 0.
