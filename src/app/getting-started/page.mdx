# Welcome to MSBD5017

This section will introduce you to the basics of our course and guide you through your first steps in MSBD5017.

## Your First Smart Contract: Hello World

Let's begin with a simple yet fundamental example in smart contract development - the "Hello World" program. This example will help you understand the basic structure of a smart contract.

### What We're Building

We'll create a smart contract named `HelloWorld` that has a single function `hello`. When called, this function will return a greeting message.

### The Code

Feel free to experiment with the code and see how your changes affect the output.

> [!tip]
> Here are a few tips to help you get started:
>
> 1. The code is automatically compiled as you type.
> 2. If you want to manually compile, press `Cmd + Shift + S` (on Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + S` (on Windows/Linux).
> 3. Try changing the return message in the `hello` function and see how it updates the output!

### Understanding the Code

Let's break down what's happening in this smart contract:

1. `contract HelloWorld`: This line declares a new smart contract named "HelloWorld".
2. `function hello() public pure returns (string memory)`: This defines a function named "hello" that:
   - Is `public`, meaning it can be called from outside the contract.
   - Is `pure`, indicating it doesn't modify or read the contract's state.
   - Returns a `string`.
3. `return "Hello, World!";`: This is the actual greeting our function returns.
