# The Mad Scientist and His Future Gadget Lab

In the bustling Akihabara district of Tokyo, a self-proclaimed mad scientist named **Okabe Rintarou**, better known by his alias **Hououin Kyouma**, founded the `Future Gadget Lab`. This eccentric workshop was destined to birth his greatest invention: the `PhoneWave (name subject to change), aka time machine`.

Okabe's relatively peaceful life takes a dark turn when Makise Kurisu, a brilliant young scientist, is found dead in Akihabara. This event sets off a chain reaction, spiraling towards a catastrophic World War III in the future.

Determined to prevent the war, Okabe decides to construct a time machine, aiming to alter the course of history and, in his words, **"Hacking to the gate"**.

## Project Phoenix: Funding the Future

However, Okabe's ambitious plan faces a significant hurdle: **funding**. His calculations indicate a need for at least **$100,000 USD**, equivalent to **100 AXC**, needed to complete the time machine and prevent World War III.

To secure this funding, Okabe initiates `Project Phoenix` - a name symbolizing the potential rebirth of a peaceful world. The project's funding mechanism works as follows:

- Investors can lock `AXC` into a smart contract.
- For every 10 `AXC` locked, the investor receives 100 `FGT` (Future Gadget Tokens).
- `FGT` can be redeemed upon the successful completion of the `Time Machine`.

> [!NOTE]
> The smart contract is so secure, even time travel can't mess with it. (at least, according to Okabe's funding statement).

## The Smart Contract Challenge

Okabe lacks the technical expertise to create the necessary smart contract for Project Phoenix and this is where you come in - can you help this `mad scientist` craft a smart contract that might just save the world?

Your mission is to develop a smart contract that can:

1. Accept and lock `AXC` deposits
2. Calculate and distribute `FGT` rewards **(Seperate contract)**
3. Lock the `FGT` rewards until the Time Machine is completed **(Let's say Year 2036)**

The smart contract implementation details as follows:

## Smart Contract Requirements

1. **Contract Creation**

   - Develop two smart contracts:
     - `Lock` contract
     - `FGT` contract (an ERC20 token)

2. **Lock Contract**

   - Implement a `lockAXC` function:
     - Must be payable
     - Each call costs 10 AXC
     - Deposit limit: 100 AXC
     - Reject new deposits when limit is reached

3. **Deposit Tracking**

   - Add a `totalDeposits` function to the `Lock` contract:
     - Returns the total amount of AXC deposited

4. **Token Minting**

   - Restrict `FGT` token minting:
     - Only the `Lock` contract can mint `FGT` tokens

5. **Token Redemption**

   - Implement a `redeem` function in the `FGT` contract:
     - Allows users to redeem their `FGT` tokens
     - Only owner of the `FGT` contract can redeem tokens
     - Redemption only possible after 2036

6. **Transfer Restriction**
   - Implement transfer restrictions in the `FGT` contract:
     - Users cannot transfer their balance to others before 2036
