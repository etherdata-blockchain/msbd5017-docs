## Deploy Your First Smart Contract

In this guide, you'll deploy your first smart contract on the `Axiomesh` blockchain. Before you begin, ensure you've completed the following checklist:

## Step 1: Compile and deploy your smart contract in the editor below

Write your smart contract in the editor below and compile it. We’ve provided a simple contract to help you get started. Make sure that your contract includes a `mint` function for the UI to work correctly.

> [!note]
> If you make changes to the contract, you’ll need to delete and redeploy it for the UI to reflect those updates.

<Example />

Once the contract is compiled, the output will be displayed below.

> [!tip]
> Solidity encodes metadata into the bytecode, which helps the EVM understand the contract's interface and ABI. You can use this [website](https://playground.sourcify.dev/) to decode the metadata.

## Step 2: Deploy your contract using Remix

First, open remix IDE by visiting [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and copy the above code into the editor.
After pasting the code, you can click compile to compile the contract.

Next, click on the `Deploy & Run Transactions` tab and select the environment as `Injected provider - MetaMask`. After selecting the environment, you can click on the `Deploy` button to deploy the contract.

After deploying the contract, you can copy the contract address and ABI from the `Deployed Contracts` section.
